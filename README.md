Computer Science graduate, 7 years of professional experience as a developer.

I work as full stack, experienced on backend and competent on frontend. I have a focus on the study of software architecture, and I love to read and write legible, well organized code. I also have a little crush on game development.

Main technologies in order of experience:
- Java (Spring Boot and JEE in general).
- Javascript (ES6, Typescript, Node, React/Next, Svelte/SvelteKit).
- C# (Unity).
- Python (fastApi, sqlmodels/sqlalchemy, pyenv, poetry).
- Go.

Although I currently work on web applications, I am always open to new oportunities in other technologies and areas that involve programming.
