Computer Science graduate, 7 years of professional experience as a developer.

I work mostly as a web application developer. While I have decent knowledge in the frontend, I tend to prefer and focus on the backend, with a pleasure to read and write legible, organized, self documented, tested and optimized code. I also have a little crush on game development.

Main technologies in order of experience:
- Java (Spring Boot and JEE in general).
- Javascript (Typescript, React, Next, Svelte, SvelteKit).
- Python (Poetry, Falcon, Fast API, Celery).
- C# (Unity, .NET).
- Currently learning Golang.

Although I currently work on web applications, I am always interested in other areas that involve programming.
