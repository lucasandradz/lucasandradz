Computer Science graduate, 8+ years of professional experience as a developer.

I specialize in web application development, having a strong background in both frontend and backend, though I have more experience and prefer the later. I am passionate in writing legible, organized, self-documented, tested, and optimized code. I also have a little crush on game development. üòÅ

Main technologies in order of experience:
- Java / Kotlin (Spring Boot, Quarkus, JEE).
- C# (Unity, .NET Core).
- Python (Poetry, Fast API, Celery).
- Javascript (Typescript, React, Next, Svelte, SvelteKit).
- Golang.

Although I currently work on web applications, I am always interested in exploring other areas of programming, particularly games. I also have experience working remotely, having been doing so since the 2020 pandemic.
